Tite
====

Tite is a web based bill splitting application, which I wrote for credit in my website development module in February and March 2015.

I didn't upload the code until now in order to avoid problems caused by new students copying my work. Even now I am choosing my words carefully to avoid it becoming searchable.

The code is in the same form as it was back then, however I have removed all references to the module code and my University ID.

The original git commits are also not being uploaded to conceal that information.

I have not checked that the code still works. I have uploaded it as an example of my most recent PHP work.
